# Restaurant

Restaurant is an app that allows you to place an order from a menu. The menu is hosted on a remote server and can be updated anytime. You can see different categories in the initial view controller. Clicking on a category presents a new screen where you can select menu items. Each item shows a picture, title, description and price. Adding items to the cart and placing an order will return a delivery time from the server.
